# Azure Cosmos DB Change Feed Library Unit Tests

Unit tests are implemented using XUnit and compatible with `dotnet test` CLI. To run Unit tests you can either:

* Open the solution in Visual Studio 2017 and use the Test Explorer
* Run `dotnet test` from the commandline while in the UnitTests folder. This works in Linux, Mac and Windows.
